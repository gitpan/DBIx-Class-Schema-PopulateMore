Revision history for Perl extension DBIx-Class-Schema-PopulateMore.

0.08 Friday, June 26, 2009
    - Fixed some documentation issues
    - fixed the copyright
    - arguments now allowed to be both array and arrayref.  This should reduce
      some line noise in some config file types or if you are just using a perl
      structure.

0.07 Friday, June 26, 2009
    - Add a placeholder to make sure the t/var directory is around at test
      time.

0.06 Thursday, June 25, 2009
    - Added SQLT to the build recommends, otherwise tests fail

0.05 Thursday, June 25, 2009
    - Updated all the required versions to more recent items, since that
      is what I can test on, plus most of that older stuff has known
      compatibility issues.
    - Requires Perl 5.8.8 since I can't test this on 5.8.6 anywhere (patches
      or test cases welcomed.) 
    - changed the way we set default timestamp on sqlite.  this fixes a lot of
      failed test cases.  Now all tests pass for me and I cleared most of the
      types of test failues I see in the backlog.
    - Updated Docs a bit.
