DBIx-Class-Schema-PopulateMore

This is a DBIC::Schema component and stand alone class that is an enhanced
version of the builtin method "$schema->populate".  What it does is make it 
easier when you are doing a first time setup and need to insert a bunch of 
rows, like the first time you deploy a new database, or after you update it.  

It's not as full featured as L<DBIx::Class::Fixtures> but is targeted more 
directly at making it easier to just take a prewritten perl structure --or one 
loaded from a configuration file-- and setup your database.

Most of us using L<DBIx::CLass> have written a version of this at one time or
another.  What is special to this component is the fact that unlike the normal
populate method you can insert to multiple result_sources in one go.  While 
doing this, we index the created rows so as to make it easy to reference them
in relationships. I did this because I think it's very ugly to have to type in 
all the primary keys by hand, particularly if your PK is multi column, or is
using some lengthy format such as uuid.  Also, we can embed macro like commands
in the row values to do inflation for us.  For example, any value starting with
"!Index:" will substitute it's value for that of the relating fields in the 
named row.

Please see the pod for L<DBIx::Class::Schema::PopulateMore> for additional details and
examples.  Also you can see the tests which provide a detailed example.
